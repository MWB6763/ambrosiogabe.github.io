# Who Am I?
Hi! I'm Gabe Ambrosio. As you can see from my website's homepage, I am a programming enthusiast with a love for adventure. I am mostly self-taught (I say mostly
  because I finally decided to get a college education), so I understand your pain when your looking for practical programming help. If you have any requests for
  articles contact me on the contact page and I will put something up for you.

  Also, if you don't understand something I wrote in an article (because sometimes it may be unintentionally cryptic) just leave a comment, and I will respond and
  edit the article. I have a lot of projects as well, check out my projects tab above. If you would like to see how I code a particular project, I have the source
  code available for free! Sometimes though, source code is not all that you need, if you would like more in depth articles, contact me and I would be glad to
  help you.

# Why is this Site Useful?
A lot of people may wonder what this site is even helpful for. I will list tutorials on events that I find difficult, or stuff that I think might be fun to learn.
I try and write my articles in an easy to understand manner, not too much for a beginner, but not too shallow for an advanced programmer. I believe that
when someone can explain material in an easy to understand way, it makes coding that much more enjoyable.

I also list articles from guests (mainly my friends :) which may contain anything from programming self-help, to building awesome creations on Minecraft. If you
have any suggested tutorials, feel free to ask me and I may help out. Some subjects I am thinking about including are:

* Math
* Physics (Basic Kinematics)
* Music (Basic Theory and Sight-Reading)
* Unity
* Unreal
* OpenGL

I just don't know if anyone is interested in learning about them. So feel free to reach out if you are!
