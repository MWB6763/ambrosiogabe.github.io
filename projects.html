<p> Here is a list of my projects. Some of them are complete and some are still in progress. Each has it's own dedicated repository under
  my github account with instructions on how to use. The way that the list below is styled is as follows. Each project starts
  with the project name, then under that is the percentage complete. These are rough estimates, and if a project says it's 100%
  complete that does not mean it's flawless, it just means I'm probably never going to touch it again. Then there is a picture that
  shows a little bit of what the project looks like.
  <br /><br/>
  If you are not a programmer I will try to include less programmer friendly ways to try these projects so you can still use them too :)</p>

    Dymond is a programming language that I created. It is programmed in Python and is a mix of Python and
    Java. The Github repository include instructions on how to compile the language and the syntactical structure.</a></p>

    This is a remake of the classic, World's Hardest Game. I coded this from scratch in Java and it was real fun
    to make. It was one of my first games from scratch so please be gracious on the poor coding ;) The instructions
    on how to download it and play can be found on the Github repo.</a></p>

    This is a game I created after following an extensive tutorial on Unity. I decided to put everything I had
    learned into practice and release an App available on the Google Play Store. I used Unity Ads to try and monetize it.
    The premise of the game is simple, tap the screen to flip the character and go for as long as possible.</p>

    I was perusing problems on </a><a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/ambrosiogabe/Poker" class="read-more"> one day and stumbled across
    a problem that asked to determine who wins a game of Poker. This will be fun I thought... and it was :). I finished the
    problem which simply fed in a feed of Poker hands in a .txt file and asked you to determine who won. After I finished
    I realized I had a Poker game in the making. So I went the next step and made it a game.</p>

    This one is a project I had to complete for a class at school. We were instructed to create
    a simple database and build a form to fill out, the form would then be inserted into the database.
    This was my take on the project, I decided
    to use Django, and I used MySql for the database.</p>

    Let's face it. This is like the "Hello world!" of game programming. I don't know how many different versions of this I have made.
    This particular version was made in Java using Swing and AWT. I have a simple AI that tracks the ball and has a certain percentage
    of error that it will have depending on the difficulty you chose. The paddles initialize as random colors and the ball changes
    to the color of whichever paddle it hits.</p>

    Quadtrees are an interesting data structure used in some 2D game engines to help with the collision detection. The premise is
    that it is implausible to test collisions against every single object with every other object in a game. So what Quadtrees do is
    break up the gameplay space into several different sections so that you only have to test the objects nearest to each other for collision.
    Unfortunately I never implemented this in any of my game engines.</p>
