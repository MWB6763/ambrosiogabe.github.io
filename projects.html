<p> Here is a list of my projects. Some of them are complete and some are still in progress. Each has it's own dedicated repository under
  my github account with instructions on how to use the given project.
  <br /><br />
  The way that the list below is styled is as follows: Each project starts
  with the project name, then under that is the percentage complete. These are rough estimates, and if a project says it's 100%
  complete that does not mean it's flawless, it just means I'm probably never going to touch it again. Then, there is a picture that
  shows a little bit of what the project looks like.
  <br /><br/>
  If you are not a programmer I will try to include less programmer friendly ways to try these projects so you can still use them too :)</p>

    I decided to expand upon my learning from the Geometry Dash game I made, and made an even more complicated engine. I switched to LWJGL so that I could handle the 
    rendering myself, which resulted in a 20% increase in CPU speed and about 1% increase in GPU speed. I was really proud of the improvements, and the engine got some 
    massive upgrades as well. I also made a Youtube series documenting this here: </a>

    This repository is the first big game I coded. I wanted to make the entire engine from scratch and really formalize my game-making skills, so I decided
    to code Geometry Dash in Java. I began to implement an AI for the game using the NEAT algorithm, however I never quite got it working right. 
    I made a Youtube series explaining how to do it yourself also, documented here: </a>

    This repository includes the link to the first representation of the programming language I am creating, called Dymond.
    It looks a bit like Javascript, but behaves more like Python, and it is incredibly slow right now. I have it coded
    in Java right now, and it just walks an AST to interpret the code you right. I am in the process of speeding it up by coding it in C :)</a></p>

    I am very proud of this game. I am in the process of creating a Minecraft clone called... Tradecraft (Fanfare).
    This is the first major 3D game I have made, and I plan on writing a book on the process. It is coded
    in C++ using the Unreal Engine for some amazing graphics. Actually, check out the next project
    on this list for a more in depth look at the book.</a></p>

    yet, mostly due to time constraints. But, it is a free book that you can read just by following this link and then pressing
    Read Now. It would encourage me to continue writing knowing that people are learning from it :)</a></p>

    This game is literally one of the first games I ever developed. It was coded in Javascript and HTML/CSS, and it was built
    from the ground up by following a tutorial from a book that introduced me to programming. It's a fun little game and you can play it
    directly by following the directions on this link. Enjoy!</a></p>

    This is a remake of the classic, <i>World's Hardest Game</i>. I coded this from the ground up in Java, and it was real fun
    to make. It was one of my first games from scratch, so please be gracious on the poor coding ;) The instructions
    on how to download it and play can be found on the Github repository.</a></p>

    This is my take on the classic laser defender. I followed a tutorial for this, but added in several of my own components.
    It's a pretty fun game, but it only works on Windows right now. I may eventually add support for Mac and Linux. It was built
    in Unity and I used open source assets for all the images. Check it out here.</a></p>

    This is a website that I am developing for a client. It is a simple website built using Express as a framework. All it is
    is a simple database containing churches in Nashville, and a search bar that allows you to search for different criteria in a search.
    The web administrator will be able to add and remove churches as they please, and feature certain churches.</a></p>

    This is a game I created after following an extensive tutorial on Unity. I decided to put everything I had
    learned into practice and release an App available on the Google Play Store. I used Unity Ads to try and monetize it.
    The premise of the game is simple, tap the screen to flip the character and go for as long as possible.</p>

    I was perusing problems on </a><a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/ambrosiogabe/Poker" class="read-more"> one day and stumbled across
    a problem that asked to determine who wins a game of Poker. This will be fun I thought... and it was :). I finished the
    problem which simply fed in a feed of Poker hands in a .txt file and asked you to determine who won. After I finished
    I realized I had a Poker game in the making. So I went the next step and made it a game.</p>

    Let's face it. This is like the "Hello world!" of game programming. I don't know how many different versions of this I have made.
    This particular version was made in Java using Swing and AWT. I have a simple AI that tracks the ball and has a certain percentage
    of error that it will have depending on the difficulty you chose. The paddles initialize as random colors and the ball changes
    to the color of whichever paddle it hits.</p>

    Quadtrees are an interesting data structure used in some 2D game engines to help with the collision detection. The premise is
    that it is implausible to test collisions against every single object with every other object in a game. So what Quadtrees do is
    break up the gameplay space into several different sections so that you only have to test the objects nearest to each other for collision.
    Unfortunately I never implemented this in any of my game engines.</p>
